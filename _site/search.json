Have a look at the business case to recall how that works.\n\n# Get the k_means_obj from the 10th center\n\n# Store as k_means_obj\n\nNext, we’ll combine the clusters from the k_means_obj with the umap_results_tbl.\n\nBegin with the k_means_obj\nAugment the k_means_obj with the stock_date_matrix_tbl to get the clusters added to the end of the tibble\nSelect just the symbol and .cluster columns\nLeft join the result with the umap_results_tbl by the symbol column\nLeft join the result with the result of sp_500_index_tbl %>% select(symbol, company, sector) by the symbol column.\nStore the output as umap_kmeans_results_tbl\n\n\n# Use your dplyr & broom skills to combine the k_means_obj with the umap_results_tbl\n\n\n# Output: umap_kmeans_results_tbl \n\nPlot the K-Means and UMAP results.\n\nBegin with the umap_kmeans_results_tbl\nUse ggplot() mapping V1, V2 and color = .cluster\nAdd the geom_point() geometry with alpha = 0.5\nApply colors as you desire (e.g. scale_color_manual(values = palette_light() %>% rep(3)))\n\n\n# Visualize the combined K-Means and UMAP results\n\nCongratulations!
